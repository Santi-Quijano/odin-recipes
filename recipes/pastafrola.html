    <h1>Pasta Frola</h1>
    <img src="../img/pastafrola.jpg" alt="traditional pastafrola">
<h3>A wonderful dessert. Another example of the influence of Italian food on Uruguayan cuisine</h3>
    <p>It is made with a cookie-like shortbread crust and quince paste filling.</p>
    <p>It may be based on the Italian crostata, which is also a pie crust that is filled with jam. Be it as it may, the main difference between the Italian version and the Uruguayan one, is the filling. </p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li> Pie crust</li>
    <li>300g of all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>80g of sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li> 
    <li>Zest of one lemon</li>
    <li>200g of cold butter</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>400g of quince paste, homemade or bought</li>
    <li>1 cup of water</li>
    <li>One egg for egg wash and coarse sugar for sprinkling</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>For the pie crust mix flour, sugar, vanilla extract, and zest of lemon into a large bowl. Then add the cold butter in small pieces. Work into crumbs the size of peas. Add the egg and knead briefly into a ball. If the dough is still too crumbly, add a splash of water. Wrapp tightly and chill for at least half an hour or overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 180 degrees Celsius then divide the dough into 1/3 and 2/3. Roll out the 2/3 first on a lightly floured surface into a circle larger than your baking form. Transfer to the form and cut off any overhang.</li>
        <li>Heat the quince paste, if you use store-bought, you will need to add water so that the paste becomes spreadable. Wait for it to cool off a bit before spreading on the prepared crust.</li>
        <li>Using the leftovers of the 2/3 and 1/3 of dough, roll out again into a large circle. How you can make the nice lattice pattern, I show in this Instagram reel. Brush with egg wash and sprinkle coarse sugar on top. Bake for about 35-40min on the lower rack or until crust is golden.</li>
        <li>The quince tart keeps if chilled properly and can easily be shipped as a gift or surprise.</li>
