    <h3>
      It is also known as chickpea flour pancake, a mouth-wateringly addictive
      main course, side dish, snack...or pizza topping
    </h3>
    <p>
      One of the neatest things about fainá is that it's arguably more popular
      in Argentina and Uruguay than it is in Genoa, Italy where it originated.
    </p>
    <p>
      With just fresh-milled dried chickpeas, water, olive oil, salt and pepper,
      fainá is both simple and delicious.
    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups of water</li>
      <li>150g of chickpea flour</li>
      <li>3g of salt</li>
      <li>3 Tbsp of olive oil</li>
      <li>ground black pepper</li>
      <li>Optional 2-3 grams sourdough starter</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Double-mill the dried chickpeas, once very coarse and a second time
        fine. You can also use store bought chickpea flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix in the water and the optional sourdough starter. Cover and let the
        batter sit a minimum of 2 hours and ideally overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        After the rest, add the salt and pepper to the batter and mix
        thoroughly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat your oven to 450F, with one shelf below the middle and another
        shelf higher than the middle of your oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put the olive oil into a cold 10-inch skillet, cast iron or stainless
        steel, and heat it on the stove. Don't let the oil get to the point of
        smoking. I have an infrared thermometer and found 360F worked well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the batter to the skillet and let it cook until the edges curl in a
        bit, 1-3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully transfer the skillet to the lower shelf of your hot oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for about 25 minutes (10 minutes on the lower shelf and another
        10-15 minutes on the higher shelf).
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a metal spatula to separate the fainá from the base of the skillet;
        then leave it in the skillet to cool for about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer to a cutting board and serve. Fainá reheats well in a toaster
        oven or on a fry pan, but is also tasty cold.
      </li>
